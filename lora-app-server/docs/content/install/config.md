# Configuration

The `lora-app-server` binary has the following command-line flags:

```text
LoRa App Server is an open-source application-server, part of the LoRa Server project
        > documentation & support: https://docs.loraserver.io/lora-app-server
        > source & copyright information: https://github.com/brocaar/lora-app-server

Usage:
  lora-app-server [flags]
  lora-app-server [command]

Available Commands:
  configfile  Print the LoRa Application Server configuration file
  help        Help about any command
  version     Print the LoRa Gateway Bridge version

Flags:
  -c, --config string   path to configuration file (optional)
  -h, --help            help for lora-app-server
      --log-level int   debug=5, info=4, error=2, fatal=1, panic=0 (default 4)

Use "lora-app-server [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Configuration file

By default `lora-app-server` will look in the following order for a
configuration file at the following paths when `--config` is not set:

* `lora-app-server.toml` (current working directory)
* `$HOME/.config/lora-app-server/lora-app-server.toml`
* `/etc/lora-app-server/lora-app-server.toml`

To load configuration from a different location, use the `--config` flag.

To generate a new configuration file `lora-app-server.toml`, execute the following command:

```bash
lora-app-server configfile > lora-app-server.toml
```

Note that this configuration file will be pre-filled with the current configuration
(either loaded from the paths mentioned above, or by using the `--config` flag).
This makes it possible when new fields get added to upgrade your configuration file
while preserving your old configuration. Example:

```bash
lora-app-server configfile --config lora-app-server-old.toml > lora-app-server-new.toml
```

Example configuration file:

```toml
[general]
# Log level
#
# debug=5, info=4, warning=3, error=2, fatal=1, panic=0
log_level=4

# The number of times passwords must be hashed. A higher number is safer as
# an attack takes more time to perform.

# PostgreSQL settings.
#
# Please note that PostgreSQL 9.5+ is required.
[postgresql]
# PostgreSQL dsn (e.g.: postgres://user:password@hostname/database?sslmode=disable).
#
# Besides using an URL (e.g. 'postgres://user:password@hostname/database?sslmode=disable')
# it is also possible to use the following format:
# 'user=loraserver dbname=loraserver sslmode=disable'.
#
# The following connection parameters are supported:
#
# * dbname - The name of the database to connect to
# * user - The user to sign in as
# * password - The user's password
# * host - The host to connect to. Values that start with / are for unix domain sockets. (default is localhost)
# * port - The port to bind to. (default is 5432)
# * sslmode - Whether or not to use SSL (default is require, this is not the default for libpq)
# * fallback_application_name - An application_name to fall back to if one isn't provided.
# * connect_timeout - Maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Zero or not specified means wait indefinitely.
# * sslcert - Cert file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
# * sslkey - Key file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
# * sslrootcert - The location of the root certificate file. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
#
# Valid values for sslmode are:
#
# * disable - No SSL
# * require - Always SSL (skip verification)
# * verify-ca - Always SSL (verify that the certificate presented by the server was signed by a trusted CA)
# * verify-full - Always SSL (verify that the certification presented by the server was signed by a trusted CA and the server host name matches the one in the certificate)

# Automatically apply database migrations.
#
# It is possible to apply the database-migrations by hand
# (see https://github.com/brocaar/lora-app-server/tree/master/migrations)

## Securing the application-server internal API

In order to protect the application-server internal API (`[application_server.internal_api]`) against
unauthorized access and to encrypt all communication, it is advised to use TLS
certificates. Once the `ca_cert`, `tls_cert` and `tls_key` are set, the
API will enforce client certificate validation on all incoming connections.
This means that when configuring a network-server instance in LoRa App Server,
you must provide the CA and TLS client certificate in order to let the
network-server to connect to LoRa App Server. See also
[network-server management]({{< ref "use/network-servers.md" >}}).

See [https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-certificates](https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-certificates)
for a set of script to generate such certificates.

## Securing the join-server API

In order to protect the join-server API (`[join_server]`) against
unauthorized access and to encrypt all communication, it is advised to use TLS
certificates. Once the `ca_cert`, `tls_cert` and `tls_key` are
set, the API will enforce client certificate validation on all incoming connections.

Please note that you also need to configure LoRa Server so that it uses a
client certificate for its join-server API client. See
[LoRa Server configuration](https://docs.loraserver.io/loraserver/install/config/).

## Web-interface and public API

The web-interface and public api (`[application_server.public_api]`) must be
secured by a TLS certificate and key, as this allows to run the gRPC and RESTful
JSON api together on one port.

### Self-signed certificate

A self-signed certificate can be generated with the following command:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 90 -nodes
```

### Let's Encrypt

For generating a certificate with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/),
first follow the [getting started](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/)
instructions. When the `letsencrypt` cli tool has been installed, execute:

```bash
letsencrypt certonly --standalone -d DOMAINNAME.HERE 
```

## Warning: deprecation warning! update your configuration

When you see this warning, you need to update your configuration!
Before LoRa App Server 0.18.0 environment variables were used for setting
configuration flags. Since LoRa App Server 0.18.0 the configuration format
has changed.

The `.deb` installer will automatically migrate your configuration. For non
`.deb` installations, you can migrate your configuration in the following way:

```bash
# Export your environment variables, in this case from a file, but anything
# that sets your environment variables will work.
set -a
source /etc/default/lora-app-server

# Create the configuration directory.
mkdir /etc/lora-app-server

# Generate new configuration file, pre-filled with the configuration set
# through the environment variables.
lora-app-server configfile > /etc/lora-app-server/lora-app-server.toml

# "Remove" the old configuration (in you were using a file).
mv /etc/default/lora-app-server /etc/default/lora-app-server.old
```
